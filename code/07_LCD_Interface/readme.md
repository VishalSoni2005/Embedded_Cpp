In the provided C code for PIC18F4550 microcontroller, 
  #pragma directives are used to configure specific aspects of the microcontroller's behavior at compile-time. 

  These configurations ensure the PIC18F4550 operates as intended:

  HS Oscillator: For stable timing (needed for LCD communication).

  WDT Off: Prevents unwanted resets during LCD operations.

  LVP Off: Simplifies pin usage (RB5 can be used for other purposes).

  PBADEN Off: Ensures PORTB pins work as digital I/O (important for the LCD data bus).
