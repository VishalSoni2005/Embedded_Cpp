1>  TRIS REGISTER: Control whether pins are inputs or outputs
        example:TRISD = 0 makes all PORTD pins outputs
                TRISD = 1 (or 0xFF) → All PORTD pins are inputs

2>  PORT REGISTER: For inputs and outputs
        In the PIC18F4550 microcontroller, each I/O port has 8 pins
        eg: PORTD have 8 pins as RD0, RD1, ... RD7

        exception: PORTA have 7 pins and PORTE only contain 3 pins , RE0, RE1, RE2 Used for ADC or Control signal


3> LATCH REGISTER (LATx)
        Used for output operations to avoid read-modify-write issues.
        Example:
            LATD = 0xAA; → Writes 10101010 to PORTD.
            Preferred over PORTx for writing outputs.
